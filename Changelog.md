## Vite-KingdomCreator-New - Changelog
###### based on Dominion Randomizer (aka Kingdom Creator) from Blakevanlan
###### reworked by gillesgros

Originately hosted at https://71yeti.fr.
It is a kingdom randomizer, or card picker, for Dominion.
As I became a maintainer for Kingdom Creator, https://www.dominionrandomizer.com might be at the same level.

Feel free to propose any improvements you see fit and send me a pull request!

## Development
it uses vue 3, vite.js, Pinia, vue-i18n and node.js v20
